# Sonar Mines vs Rocks Prediction Project

## Description
The Mines and Rocks Prediction project is a Machine Learning model built using Python to identify and classify types of mines and rocks based on data patterns. It uses algorithms to learn from data and make predictions, helping with geology and mining tasks. This project applies Python basics to handle, analyze, and predict geological data.

## Features
- **Data Analysis**: Explore and preprocess geological data.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Implements algorithms for prediction.
- **Visualization**: Visualize data patterns for better understanding.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualization)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shivesh7630/mines-and-rocks-prediction.git
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd mines-and-rocks-prediction

3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
