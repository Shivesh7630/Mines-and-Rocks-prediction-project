# Mines-and-Rocks-prediction-project
The Mines and Rocks Prediction project is a Machine Learning model built using Python to identify and classify types of mines and rocks based on data patterns. It uses algorithms to learn from data and make predictions, helping with geology and mining tasks. This project applies Python basics to handle, analyse, and predict geological data.
